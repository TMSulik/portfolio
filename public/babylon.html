							<h1>The Lottery in Babylon</h1>
							
							<div class='content' >
								
								<p class='dropcap' >
									
									Like all Babylonian men, I was once a proconsul, like all—a slave. I am also acquainted with powerlessness, disgrace, and prison. Look here: my right hand is missing its index finger. Look here, through the tear in my cape: a red scar on my belly, branded with the Hebrew letter Beth. This mark, on the night of a full moon, places me in command over men branded with the letter Gimmel, but leaves me subordinate to those bearing an Aleph. The Alephs, in turn, must take orders from the Gimmels on moonless nights.</p>
									
									<p>At the break of dawn, in a cellar, I have slit the throat of a sacred bull, sacrificing it before a black altar. During the entire lunar year, I was declared invisible: I could cry out without being heard, steal bread without being beheaded. I have known something the Greeks do not know: uncertainty. In a bronze chamber, facing the hangman’s silent hood, hope did not abandon me; in the river of delights, panic did not fail me.</p>

									<p>Heraclitus Ponticus noted, approvingly, that Pythagoras claimed, to have been Phyrro in a previous life, and before that, Euphorbus, and before that, some other mortal. For me to make a similar claim, I have no need to resort to reincarnation or occultism.</p> 
									
									<p>I owe this hideous variety of lives to an institution, one that other societies either lack or carry out only partially, or in secret: the Lottery. I have not delved deeply into its history. I know that scholars have not reached a consensus on this. I know as much about its effective principles as one not versed in astrology might know about the influences of the Moon. I live in a precarious country where the Lottery constitutes a key aspect of reality. Until today, I had thought as little about it as I have about intangible spirits or my immaterial soul. Now, far from Babylon and her beloved traditions, I ponder—with considerable astonishment—the Lottery and the blasphemous speculations it elicits—conjectures whispered by shrouded men in the twilight hours.</p> 
									 
									<p>My father maintained that in the old days—going back years? centuries?—the Babylonian lottery was a popular game among the common folk. He claimed (whether accurately or in error) that barbers exchanged copper coins for rectangular tokens—decorated with symbols and made from bone or parchment. In broad daylight they would hold a drawing. Once fate had played its hand, the winners would receive coins minted in silver. The whole procedure was quite basic, as you can see.</p>

									<p>Naturally, these “lotteries” failed. They were bereft of any moral force. They failed to address man’s primal needs—other than hope. Faced with public indifference, the brokers who conducted these crude lotteries began losing money. Then, someone introduced an innovation: the inclusion of losing numbers along with winners. On the new rules, those who purchase the numbered rectangles signed up for two possibilities: to win a jackpot or to pay a fine—sometimes considerably large. This slight risk (for every 30 winning numbers there was one unlucky number) naturally sparked public interest. Babylonians lined up to play. Anyone averse to taking chances was labeled gutless, a coward.</p>

									<p>Over time this justified contempt found a second target: the public shaming extended beyond those who refused to play and spread as well to those who lost were subject to fines. The Corporation (which is what it came to be called at that time) had to reward the winners, but would lack the funds to cover the payouts should the fines collected from the losers fall even a little short. There were lawsuits filed against the losers: judges ordered them to pay the original fine, with interest, or else do jail time. In solidarity, as an act of protest, everyone chose jail. In the wake of this minor revolt, the supreme authority of the Corporation sprung forth: its grounds for legitimacy were, henceforth, to be spiritual or faith-based.</p>

									Shortly thereafter, the losing tickets no longer carried fines, only numbers of days of a prison term. This revision, hardly noted at the time, carried significant implications: the introduction of nonfinancial elements into the Lottery. It was a great success. Under demand from the players, the Corporation was compelled to increase the number of losing tickets.
